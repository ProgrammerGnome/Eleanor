## Evaluation

Eleanor uses a **fully neural network-based evaluation function**, entirely trained on self-play data from an initially simple HCE using the [bullet](https://github.com/jw1912/bullet) trainer.  

**Architecture:** `(768 -> 256)x2 -> 1x8`  
A basic 256-hidden-layer *perspective net* with 8 output buckets.

## Installation

> **Prerequisites:**  
> - `clang++` compiler  
> - Access to `make` command  

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run `make` in the root directory  
3. Enjoy your executable ðŸŽ‰

## How to Use

You can interact with the engine via these commands:

- `position` â€” Set the board state using a [FEN](https://www.chess.com/terms/fen-chess):  
  - `position fen [FEN]` or  
  - `position startpos`

- `ucinewgame` â€” Resets the position and game state  
- `quit` â€” Terminates the program  
- `go` â€” Begins search and returns the best move  
  - Parameters (all in **milliseconds**):  
    - `wtime`, `btime` â€” Remaining time for white/black  
    - `winc`, `binc` â€” Increment time for white/black  

- `stop` â€” Stops the current search  
- `bench` â€” Runs a speed benchmark on a set of positions  

The engine can be used in any GUI with **UCI support**.

## Sources I Used

- [Stockfish Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GWDRS3kU6R) â€” The best possible source for an engine dev.
- [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) â€” Contains some good articles. Used it mostly when started the project.
- [Maksim Korzh's Chess Engine in C (YouTube Series)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUNP-UjujBM&list=PLmN0neTso3Jxh8ZIylk74JpwfiWNI76Cs) â€” it was a good series helping with some fundamental stuff early on.
