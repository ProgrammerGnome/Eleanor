<h1 align="center">Eleanor Chess Engine â€“ Search & Heuristics Fork</h1>

# Forked from [rektdie/Eleanor](https://github.com/rektdie/Eleanor)

This repository is a **fork of the Eleanor chess engine**.  
The goal of this fork is not to develop the full engine, but to specifically **analyze, visualize, and experiment with search algorithms and heuristics**.  

## Focus Areas

- Analysis of search algorithms  
- Comparison of heuristics and evaluation metrics  
- Visualizations of the search process  
- Experimental modifications and improvements for performance  

## Current Search Features

- Negamax  
- Quiescent Search  
- Transposition Table  
- Move Ordering  
  - TT, SEE + MVV-LVA, Killers, History  
- Iterative Deepening  
  - Aspiration Windows  
- Principal Variation Search (PVS)  
- Reverse Futility Pruning  
  - Improving  
- Null Move Pruning  
- Late Move Reductions  
  - Log formula  
  - Cutnode  
  - History  
- Late Move Pruning  
- Futility Pruning  
- QS SEE Pruning  
- PVS SEE Pruning  

## Plans

- Visualizations of search trees and decision processes  
- Comparing heuristic efficiency across different positions  
- Experimenting with alternative search strategies
